# Pending Issues with This Assignment That I Did Not Manage to Solve

The only issue with this assignment was that I missed the lectures and was 
not clear on how the Java application uses Postman for implementation before 
I started working on the assignment.

Issues I haven't resolved include:
- Only a couple of the test pass but I 100% believe it has to do with my java skill and not the concept of the assignment.
- AFTER DEADLINE NOTE:  I actually figured out the java issues and now all the test pass :)
